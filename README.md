# Journeys

## Introduction

A Python implementation of the coding problem [found
here](https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys), which I initially found ]via
Kim Richmond](https://github.com/Lethrir/Journeys).

## Running

This code is written for Python 3.8 or higher. It also makes use of
[`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to handle the virtual
environment. A `Makefile` is provided to make things a little easier.

Assuming you have both `pipenv` and Python 3.8 installed, running up this
could should simply require:

```sh
$ make setup
$ make
```

Once `make setup` has been executed once just running `make` will be fine
for subsequent runs.
